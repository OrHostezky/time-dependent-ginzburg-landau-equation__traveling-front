# Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau Equation - Traveling Front

In this work, basic simulations and analysis are carried out of a certain traveling-front case of the 1-dimensional Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau Equation (TDGLE). This equation is a PDE that involves diffusion and an additional reaction(s), namely
```math
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+f(u)    \quad ,
```
where $u(x,t)$ can be regarded as a particle density, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $f(u)$ is the reaction function, which describes additionl, density-dependent effects in the system.
Specifically, the TDGLE involves a *bistable* reaction function, which by itself has two stable fixed points, introducing two stable phases to which the solution tends at long times. 
Here, a generic cubic reaction function is considered, namely $f(u)=-k(u-u_1)(u-u_2)(u-u_3)$ for $k>0$ and  (a detailed chemical intuition can be drawn for $f(u)$, see [paper](Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau Equation - Traveling Front.pdf)).
Due to the fact that there are two stable phases in the infinite problem, a competition between the two can be generated by feeding the equation with initial conditions that has certain properties

The dynamics are numerically solved for using *MATLAB*'s built-in PDE solver `pdepe` solver, which discretizes space and integrates the ODEs resulting from this spatial discretization to obtain the approximate solutions at the desired times.
